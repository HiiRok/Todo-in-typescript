# Todo-App-using-Typescript

This is a simple Todo app built using TypeScript. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and TypeScript installed on your machine.

## Installation
1.Clone this repository to your local machine.

2.Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3.Run the following command to install the dependencies and start the application: 

###  `npm install`

### `npm start`

## Features

1.Create a new task by entering a task name and clicking "Add Task."

2.Delete a task by clicking the task.

## Key Points

1.Strongly Typed: TypeScript is used to enforce static typing, providing clear and explicit types for variables, function parameters, and return values.

2.Interfaces and Classes: The app uses interfaces and classes for defining the structure of data, keeping the code organized and easy to understand.

3.Modularity: Code is structured into separate modules (models and utils) to encapsulate functionality and promote reusability.

4.Proper Typing for Local Storage: The localStorage.ts file provides type-safe access to local storage, reducing the risk of runtime errors related to incorrect data types.

5.Type Annotations: TypeScript annotations are added where necessary to improve code readability and maintainability.

6.Good Variable Naming: Descriptive variable names are used throughout the codebase to enhance code clarity.

7.Usage of TypeScript Features: The code uses various TypeScript features, such as readonly properties, optional properties, and more, to make the code concise and expressive.

## Acknowledgments

The Todo app was inspired by various existing Todo applications.

Thanks to the TypeScript and Node.js communities for their valuable tools and packages.
